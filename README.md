# Sprite-Converter
Created for use in the Space Fighter project, this Sprite Converter creates C code by grabbing pixel information from .bmp image files. The C Code stores all the graphical information in structures, in order to lower the amount of data used. This also means that the hosting system does not need to interpret any type of image format in order to compile this code.

I have made this it's own seperate repository, as I believe it deserves its own spot as a repository while the Space Fighter remains in development.
